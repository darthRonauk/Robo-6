# Robo-6
Robo-6 is a serial transmission robot car based on Java platform. It implements an Arduino micro-controller to receive the serial transmission sent by the Java program and drives the wheels based on the command. It is named Robo-6 because it is the sixth model in the series of robots made by me.
